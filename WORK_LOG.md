| Aug 23 |  4-5pm   |  I checked over my work from class and realized my ceaser cypher shift was wrong, so I went back and fixed that. Then I spent a while thinking about the next one till I realized the range of the numbers was similar to the ASCII setup. It took me a while to work through that and actually get a translation that made sense.                                                                      I |

It was pretty obvious it was binary, but breaking it up into sectios of 8 took a decent bit of time till I had something that made sense. I also thought about the next part and started brainstorming coding it. |
